# Festival Business Architecture

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-05-23  
**Implementation Target**: Stage 4 - Step 3 (Stream URL Processing [Index: 27])

---

## üé™ **Executive Summary**

Minefest-Core implements an enterprise-grade business model for virtual music festivals using automated ticketing, permission-based access control, and obfuscated audio streaming. The system prevents piracy while providing seamless user experience and automated revenue protection.

---

## üîÑ **Automated Ticket Processing Architecture**

### **Tibex Integration Flow**
```
Customer Purchase ‚Üí Tibex Automation ‚Üí Terminal Commands ‚Üí LuckPerms ‚Üí Instant Access
```

**1. Purchase Processing**
- Customer buys ticket through external sales platform
- Tibex receives purchase notification automatically
- Tibex executes terminal commands on BungeeCord server
- Commands add appropriate permissions to user's LuckPerms profile

**2. Access Activation**
- Permissions granted in real-time (no server restart required)
- User immediately gains access to purchased content
- Time-limited permissions automatically managed by Tibex
- Refunds processed automatically with permission revocation

**3. Multi-Tier Support**
- Different permission nodes for different ticket types
- Automatic upgrade/downgrade based on purchase changes
- Cross-festival permission management for multi-event operators

## üé´ **Permission Structure & Ticket Tiers**

### **Core Permission Nodes**
```
minefest.festival.access           # Basic festival entry
minefest.festival.stage.main       # Main stage audio access
minefest.festival.stage.secondary  # Secondary stage access
minefest.festival.stage.acoustic   # Acoustic stage access
minefest.festival.vip              # VIP area access
minefest.festival.backstage        # Backstage access
minefest.festival.premium          # Premium audio quality
minefest.festival.multistream      # Multiple simultaneous streams
```

### **Ticket Tier Implementation**
| Tier | Permissions | Audio Quality | Features |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **General Admission** | `minefest.festival.access`<br>`minefest.festival.stage.main` | 128kbps MP3 | Single main stage |
| **Multi-Stage** | `minefest.festival.access`<br>`minefest.festival.stage.*` | 192kbps MP3 | All stages |
| **VIP** | Above + `minefest.festival.vip` | 320kbps MP3 | VIP areas + priority |
| **Premium** | Above + `minefest.festival.premium` | FLAC/Lossless | Highest quality |
| **Backstage** | Above + `minefest.festival.backstage` | Multi-stream | Behind scenes access |

### **Time-Based Access Control**
- Tibex manages permission expiration automatically
- Day passes: 24-hour permission duration
- Weekend passes: Multi-day permission blocks
- Season passes: Extended duration with renewal
- Automatic cleanup on expiration (no manual intervention)

## üîê **Security Architecture**

### **Multi-Layer Security Model**

**Layer 1: Permission Validation**
```java
// Real-time LuckPerms permission checking
public boolean hasStageAccess(ServerPlayer player, String stageId) {
    return player.hasPermission("minefest.festival.stage." + stageId) &&
           player.hasPermission("minefest.festival.access");
}
```

**Layer 2: Token Obfuscation**
```java
// Server-side token generation with obfuscation
public String generateStreamToken(ServerPlayer player, String stageId, String realUrl) {
    if (!hasStageAccess(player, stageId)) {
        return null; // Access denied
    }
    
    String token = UUID.randomUUID().toString() + "_" + System.currentTimeMillis();
    TokenManager.registerToken(token, realUrl, player.getUUID(), stageId);
    return token;
}
```

**Layer 3: Network Protection**
- Minecraft server acts as secure proxy
- Real radio stream URLs never transmitted to clients
- Client-side packet inspection yields only meaningless tokens
- Server-side rate limiting and abuse prevention

### **Anti-Piracy Features**

**Stream URL Protection**
- Real radio URLs remain server-side only
- Clients receive obfuscated tokens: `a7f3d9e1-b2c4-4567-8901-234567890abc_1732377600000`
- Tokens expire automatically with permissions
- No direct radio server access possible

**Session Management**
- Tokens tied to specific player UUID and session
- Automatic token invalidation on logout/disconnect
- Per-user token limits prevent abuse
- Geographic validation (optional) for location-based events

**Revenue Protection**
- Impossible to share stream access (tokens are player-specific)
- Time-limited access prevents long-term sharing
- Automatic refund processing with instant access revocation
- Audit trail for all access attempts and token generation
